/**
 A type that handles the process of requesting the authorization information and
 refreshing the access token using the [Authorization Code Flow][1].

 Conforming types may communicate directly with the Spotify web API (see
 ``AuthorizationCodeFlowClientBackend``), or they may communicate with a custom
 backend server that you setup (see ``AuthorizationCodeFlowProxyBackend``) which
 itself communicates with the Spotify web API. This server can safely store your
 client secret, which prevents it from being exposed in your frontend app. This
 is the key reason for using a backend server.

 See also [SpotifyAPIServer][2], a backend server that can handle authorization
 process.
 
 Furthermore, after your backend server retrieves the authorization information
 from Spotify, it could encrypt it before sending it back to your app. Your app
 could then decrypt this information when it receives it, providing an
 additional layer of security.

     the
     ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager/requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(redirectURIWithQuery:state:)``
     method of ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager``
     calls this method in order to retrieve the authorization information.

     If the `redirectURIWithQuery` contains an error parameter or the value for
     the state parameter doesn't match the value passed in as an argument to the
     above method, then an error will be thrown *before* this method is called.

     This method must return the authorization information as JSON data that can
     be decoded into ``AuthInfo``. The ``AuthInfo/accessToken``,
     ``AuthInfo/refreshToken``, and ``AuthInfo/expirationDate`` (which can be
     decoded from the "expires_in" JSON key) properties must be non-`nil`. For
     example:

     ```
     {
        "access_token": "NgCXRK...MzYjw",
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "scope": "user-read-private user-read-email",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "refresh_token": "NgAagA...Um_SHo"
     }
     ```

     If Spotify returns one of the documented error objects, such as
     ``SpotifyAuthenticationError``, do not decode the data into one of these
     types yourself; this will be done by the caller. If you are communicating
     with a custom backend server and it returns its own error response, decode
     it into a custom error type and throw it as an error to downstream
     subscribers.

     retrieve this data [here][1].
