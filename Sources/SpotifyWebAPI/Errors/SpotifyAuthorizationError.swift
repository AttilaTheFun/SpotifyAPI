/**
 The user denied your app's authorization request or there was an error during
 the process of authorizing your app.

 This error will only be thrown during the process of requesting access and
 refresh tokens using ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager`` or
 ``AuthorizationCodeFlowPKCEBackendManager``. More specifically, it is created
 from the "error" (and possibly the "state") parameter of the query string of
 the redirect URI. It is *not* decoded from the response body of a request.

 Do not confuse this with ``SpotifyAuthenticationError``. See also:
 
 * ``SpotifyError``
 * ``SpotifyPlayerError``
 * ``RateLimitedError``
 * ``SpotifyGeneralError``
 
 See the [authorization process][1].
